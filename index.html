		<h1>Black Sabbath</h1>
		<h2>War Pigs</h2>
		<p>
			Generals gathered in their masses <br>
			Just like witches at black masses <br>
			Evil minds that plot destruction <br>
			Sorcerer of death's construction <br>
		</p>
		<p>
			In the fields the bodies burning <br>
			As the war machine keeps turning <br>
			Death and hatred to mankind <br>
			Poisoning their brainwashed minds<br>
			Oh, Lord, yeah<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Politicians hide themselves away <br>
			They only started the war <br>
			Why should they go out to fight? <br>
			They leave that role to the poor <br>
			Yeah
		</p>
		<p>
			Time will tell on their power minds <br>
			Making war just for fun <br>
			Treating people just like pawns in chess <br>
			Wait 'till their judgement day comes<br>
			Yeah<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Now in darkness world stops turning <br>
			Ashes where their bodies burning <br>
			No more war pigs have the power <br>
			Hand of God has struck the hour <br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Day of judgement, God is calling <br>
			On their knees the war pigs crawling <br>
			Begging mercies for their sins <br>
			Satan laughing, spreads his wings <br>
			Oh, Lord, yeah<br>
		</p>
