	<h1>Black Sabbath</h1>
	<h2>War Pigs</h2>
	<p>
		Generals gathered in their masses 
		Just like witches at black masses 
		Evil minds that plot destruction 
		Sorcerer of death's construction 
	</p>
	<p>
		In the fields the bodies burning 
		As the war machine keeps turning 
		Death and hatred to mankind 
		Poisoning their brainwashed minds
		Oh, Lord, yeah
	</p>
	<p>
		Politicians hide themselves away 
		They only started the war 
		Why should they go out to fight? 
		They leave that role to the poor 
		Yeah
	</p>
	<p>
		Time will tell on their power minds 
		Making war just for fun 
		Treating people just like pawns in chess 
		Wait 'till their judgement day comes
		Yeah
	</p>
	<p>
		Now in darkness world stops turning 
		Ashes where their bodies burning 
		No more war pigs have the power 
		Hand of God has struck the hour 
	</p>
	<p>
		Day of judgement, God is calling 
		On their knees the war pigs crawling 
		Begging mercies for their sins 
		Satan laughing, spreads his wings 
		Oh, Lord, yeah
	</p>
